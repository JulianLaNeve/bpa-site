                    Many of you probably heard of Amanda Todd. She was in 7th grade when she committed suicide. What most of you do not know it was because of cyber-bullying. She would go with friends on webcam to meet and talk to new people." At one point, a stranger flattered her into flashing the camera. One year later, a man contacted her on Facebook, threatening to send around the picture of her topless. After she refused the picture got released all over the internet. Amanda developed anxiety, depression, and anxiety disorders, she says in the video, followed by a path into drugs and alcohol. She then changed schools and found a new group of friends in an effort to leave behind the bullies. Then the man then created a Facebook profile, using her uncensored photo as his profile picture. "Cried every night, lost all my friends and respect people had for me... again... then nobody liked me," she wrote. Soon after, the bullying started again and she began to cut herself. Amanda moved to yet another school, where, after a boy began flirting with her, a troupe of girls from her first school came and beat her up. "Kids filmed it," she writes. "I was all alone and left on the ground."Teachers ran over but I just went and layed in a ditch and my dad found me." When she went home with her dad, she drank bleach in an attempt to kill herself, but was saved after a rushed trip to the hospital. Amanda's bullying continued despite moving to a new city. Anti-depressants and counseling did little to combat the severe depression. She made a youtube video posting all of this and the following is an excerpt of what was on it:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    I'm struggling to stay in this world, because everything just touches me so deeply. I'm not doing this for attention. I'm doing this to be an inspiration and to show that I can be strong. I did things to myself to make pain go away, because I'd rather hurt myself then someone else. Haters are haters but please don't hate, although im sure I'll get them. I hope I can show you guys that everyone has a story, and everyones future will be bright one day, you just gotta pull through. I'm still here aren't I? Later after she said that she killed

                    Then on October 12, 2012 she was found dead in her room, due to suicide.
