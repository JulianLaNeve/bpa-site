            There are many steps when it comes to dealing with a cyberbully:
            <br>
            <ol>
                <li>Make them seem like you are calm and confident. Not the end of the world if you look scared. If it is really getting to you, let an adult know. </li>
                <li>
                    Cycle Breathe For Calm. Train Calm by breathing in through your nose for a count of 2; holding your breath for a count of 2, then exhaling for a count of 2. Repeat.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Keep Remarks Brief. It is important to say something. Verbalizing and breathing breaks up your fear and gets your mind and body. Do not beg. Make a brief declarative statement. Do not make it harsh, simply just state your reason.
                </li>
                <li>De-escalate Thru Deflection. Deflect any and all incoming insults and threats.You should never let the insults get to you. If respond in a harsh manner then that will only encourage the bully to continue. If you do not react the way he wants you to then the bullying will stop. </li>
            </ol>
            <p>If none of those steps work then do the following: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Saving the evidence of the cyberbullying, keep abusive text messages or a screenshot of a webpage, for example, and then report them to a trusted adult, such as a family member, teacher, or school counselor. If you don't report incidents, the cyber bully will often become more aggressive.
                </li>
                <li>Reporting threats of harm and inappropriate sexual messages to the police. In many cases, the cyber bully's actions can be prosecuted by law.</li>
                <li>Being relentless. Cyberbullying is rarely limited to one or two incidents. It's far more likely to be a sustained attack on you over a period of time. So, like the cyberbully, you may have to be relentless and keep reporting each and every bullying incident until it stops. There is no reason for you to ever put up with cyberbullying.</li>
                <li>Preventing communication from the cyberbully, by blocking their email address, cell phone number, and deleting them from social media contacts. Report their activities to their internet service provider (ISP) or to any social media or other web sites they use to target you. The cyber bully’s actions may constitute a violation of the website’s terms of service or, depending on the laws in your area, may even warrant criminal charges. </li>
            </ul>
